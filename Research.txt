From the video: simulation of a spring is easy, maybe implement that at first

Blog describing the spring case: https://benmoseley.blog/my-research/so-what-is-a-physics-informed-neural-network/
example of the spring case: https://github.com/benmoseley/harmonic-oscillator-pinn/blob/main/Harmonic%20oscillator%20PINN.ipynb (from the blog)

Failure modes, possible fixes if the training doesn't go well: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01050
