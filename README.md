# Physics Informed Neural Network

This is a project made at the HES-SO in Sion for my Bachelor's degree. The goal is to explore Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and apply them to fluid simulations.

At first, we will have to simulate a Poiseuille and a Von Karman instability in 2D and in a steady state.

We have to compare results to traditional methods. We want to know how accurate and efficient PINNs are.

We then want to simulate a Von Karman instability in an unsteady state, meaning over time, in 2 dimensions.
With that, we want to evaluate PINNs for fluid simulation in this domain.

Finally, we want to try to simulate more complex situations, either with 3D simulations or by adding obstacles to previous simulations.
