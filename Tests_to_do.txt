Different things to try to train the model:

- Size of the NN: test with 100x10, 200x10
- Test SiLU/Tanh act func
- Number of input points: test between 10'000, 50'000
- Create new random input points or keep the same points
- BC only learning phase: test with training the model only on the BC at first for a few epochs
- Train the model for longer, reducing the LR as it goes (50'000 epoch, 100'000 epochs, 200'000 epochs)
- Modify zone weights (more points on BC or equally distributed points)
- Bigger "walls" zones
- Add regularization (dropout etc...)
- Modify simulation parameters?

--------------------------------------------------------
Test1: 200x10 NN Tanh act func, 10'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 20'000 epochs, 50'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 25'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Result: As seen in the output file and loss graphs, at some point the loss gets "stuck" and starts hovering in the same place, specifically
for the BCs' losses. We can also see in the output file that 20'000 epochs for only the BCs loss is not necessary, we will stop at 5'000.
We also see that the speeds kind of "averaged", and the pressure is constant along the whole domain, which is probably caused by the BCs 
not being learned correctly. The learning may aslo be influenced by the randomly generated points, as during testing sometimes we get out 
of the "averaged" situation. We might want to find a way to stop the learning based on the losses value instead of doing a certain number
of epochs in the future

--------------------------------------------------------
Test2: 200x10 NN Tanh act func, 10'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 50'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 25'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Result: We are now out of the "averaged" situation. We see that around 41'000 epochs, a new gradient is found which allows the loss to 
become a bit smaller, but then it hovers again around new values, in the same way as before. We may need to explore a bit more broadly,
maybe we are reducting the LR too much. For the next test, we will try running for more epochs and not lowering the LR for longer.

--------------------------------------------------------
Test3: 200x10 NN Tanh act func, 10'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 100'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 5e-4 after 75'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Result: We don't really see any improvement over longuer trainings. Maybe the NN is too big and training is taking very long to give 
meaninful results. Or maybe we don't have enough points in the domain. Next test should be with a smaller NN and then we will try with
more points.

--------------------------------------------------------
Test4: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 10'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 100'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 75'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Results: We might have to make the displayed loss graphs more readable... Otherwise this seems way better than the previous tests, 
with better losses on the BCs and physics that is better respected. We have to test different things to make the training better, and 
I want to start trying again with more points

--------------------------------------------------------
Test5: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 20'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 100'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 75'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Results: A bit better than Test4, the loss displaying is a bit better too, maybe we could do an average too to make it more readable. 
Now that we have something that looks more or less correct, I want to try using SiLU act func to compare, and then we should try 
different things,
- Different densities on domain (add back "center" density)
- More points
- More epochs
- Regularization
We also notice very well the point where we go from 1e-3 to 1e-4 LR value, at 75'000 epoch

--------------------------------------------------------
Test6: 100x10 NN SiLU act func, 20'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 100'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 75'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Results: Went from ~65 to ~45 epochs/sec, SiLU is more expensive to compute. Results were worse, back in the "averaged" situation. 
Maybe the parameters used in this test are better suited to the Tanh act func, and SiLU might work if I change the parameters a bit,
but right now I think it's better to try and improve with the Tanh act func. Next test we will try again with Tanh, and increase 
density in the center of the simulation to see if it can improve the results.

--------------------------------------------------------
Test7: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 20'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 100'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 75'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls, higher density in the center of the 
simulation and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Results: Although the loss was lower in this case, the results weren't as good when comparing to the theorical poiseuille. The loss 
also looked like it was still getting smaller, and it seems like we could reduce the LR earlier and one more time in the next test.
This will be done with the higher density in the middle first, then in the base case from before

--------------------------------------------------------
Test8: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 20'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 150'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 50'000 epochs and from 1e-4 to 1e-5 after 100'000, with higher points density in the walls, 
higher density in the center of the simulation and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Results: The higher density middle part seems to be detrimental to the simulation, as this one looks similar to the previous test.
The results are worse but the loss is lower, This might be due to the fact that the speeds in the second half of the domain is 
nearly 0, which validates the physics loss function, and the error would be only on the "transition" between speed and no speed.
The when we compute the loss, the average would be small. Not sure if this is due to the higher density middle, will try without it.
Then we can also try with even more points in a next test.

--------------------------------------------------------
Test9: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 20'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 150'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 50'000 epochs and from 1e-4 to 1e-5 after 100'000, with higher points density in the walls and
0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Results: We have the same problem as the two previous tests. At some number of epochs, maybe due to too much training, the results
get worse even though the loss seems to do well. I want to go back to 100k epochs and 1e-3 to 1e-4 LR and increase the number of 
points to see if this would be better.

--------------------------------------------------------
Test10: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 50'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 100'000 total epochs
reducing LR from 1e-3 to 1e-4 after 50'000 epochs with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Result: We still have problems with the speed tending to 0 when x gets bigger. This might be because that we have more points in the 
walls (no_slip zone) than in the actual simulated flow (~2x more points). In the next test, I'll try to make the density even on the 
whole domain.

--------------------------------------------------------
Test11: After the meeting, few new things to try. We noticed that 1e-3 LR was probably too big, and we also decided to randomize the
model weights initialisation. We also reduced the weights on the BCs losses. 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 50'000 input points, no new input
points created, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 100'000 total epochs reducing LR from 1e-4 to 1e-5 after 50'000 epochs with higher points 
density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Result: We can see improvement in the pressure gradient, which is not reversed anymore, but the flow is worse than before. This may be 
due to the weights. We also see that we might be lowering the LR too fast. Next test will be with batches, generating 50'000 points in
batches of 5000, generating new input points every epoch

--------------------------------------------------------
Test12: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 50'000 input points in batches of 5000, new inputs every epoch, BC only for 5'000 epochs, 75'000 total
epochs fixed LR at 1e-4, higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization

Result: We don't really see a big difference compared to the previous test. It also takes way longer to run the script with batches. I 
want to try and use a LBFGS in the next test.

--------------------------------------------------------
Test13: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 50'000 input points, new inputs every epoch,  75'000 total epochs moving LR from 1e-4, dividing it by 
5 every 20'000 epoch, higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization.

Results: The results were once again similar, reducing the LR seems effective. I also noticed that the outlet BC fixed the pressure at 0
Which is a problem because we also fixed the inlet pressure. Modified the outlet so that the BC is on the pressure gradient in y instead

--------------------------------------------------------
Test14: Changing test method a bit, now I will set a goal to the new test and explain the modifications I did and why, as well as stating
what we expect from the results and if we got what we expected. Here is the starting point: 100x10 NN Tanh act func, 50'000 input points,
new inputs every epoch, 150'000 total epochs moving LR from 1e-4, dividing it by 5 every 30'000 epoch, higher points density in the walls
and 0.01 walls thickness, no regularization.
What we changed: The outlet BC is now on the dpdy gradient at the outlet, changed from fixed outlet pressure. We expect the pressure 
gradient across x to be continuous now, and the physics to be better respected. This can be found in commit 

Results:
