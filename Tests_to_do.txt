Different things to try to train the model:

- Size of the NN: test with 100x10, 200x10
- Test SiLU/Tanh act func
- Number of input points: test with 10'000, 50'000
- Create new random input points or keep the same points
- BC only learning phase: test with training the model only on the BC at first for a few epochs
- Train the model for longer, reducing the LR as it goes (50'000 epoch, 100'000 epochs, 200'000 epochs)
- Modify zone weights (more points on BC or equally distributed points)
- Bigger "walls" zones

First test: 200x10 NN Tanh act func, 10'000 input points, no new input points created, BC only for 20'000 epochs, 50'000 total epochs
reducing LR by factor 0.1 after 25'000 epochs, with higher points density in the walls and 0.01 walls thickness
