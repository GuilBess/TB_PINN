From the video: simulation of a spring is easy, maybe implement that at first

Blog describing the spring case: https://benmoseley.blog/my-research/so-what-is-a-physics-informed-neural-network/
example of the spring case: https://github.com/benmoseley/harmonic-oscillator-pinn/blob/main/Harmonic%20oscillator%20PINN.ipynb (from the blog)

Failure modes, possible fixes if the training doesn't go well: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01050

For the Poiseuille sim: Plane Poiseuille flow?
Poiseuille flow in different cases: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagen%E2%80%93Poiseuille_equation

For Karman: We just take a "screenshot" of a system at a certain time?

Navier-Stokes : Video explaining what they are https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ra7aQlenTb8

Vector field divergeance : 3:00 in the vid

we have to create the physical loss function from the Navier-Stokes equation, with conservation of mass 
∇ • u = 0, 
with u the velocity vector field and ∇ • the divergeance

and conservation of momentum (Newton's second law rewritten)
ρ (du/dt) = -∇p + μ ∇²u + F, 
with ρ the density, p the pressure, μ the viscosity, u the velocity vector field and F other forces that might apply (usually gravity, do we ignore it?)

We want to find the correct PDE for the different cases, the we can use pytorch's autograd function to compute the residual of the differential equation

How do we choose which points do we take?
